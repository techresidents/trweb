    <title>JSDoc: Class: This class should be subclassed by async commands.

Convenience onSuccess and onError methods are provided
which are intended to be passed to the async facility
performing the operaion. This is typically an Ajax 
request through a library which supports invoking
a success or error callback.

Simply pass this.onSuccess and this.onError to your
Ajax library and these methods will take care of
invoking the user specified callbacks in options.onSuccess
and options.onError (if provided).

Since the arguments passed to this.onSuccess and this.onError
by the Ajax library are dynamic, this class provides 
asyncCallbackArgs, asyncSuccessCallbackArgs, and asyncErrorCallbackArgs
properties which should be overriden with the argument names
so that arguments can in turn be passed meaningfully to
the user specified callbacks.

Note that the options.onSuccess and options.onError will be invoked
with the following two arguments:

1) {Object} options (same options passed into execute method())
2) {Object} response object containing boolean status and
            arguments named in the callback args arrays.</title>
