                a requisition now, or you can come back to

            <p>While searching for talent you can take notes and
                score candidates in the context of a job requisition.</p>
            <p>For teams, we encourage each member of the
                team to create an account so they can individually
                score candidates and cast their vote to make offers.<p>

            <p>Once you have found a talented developer and
                decided to move forward in the hiring process, extend them
                an interview offer using our tools.</p>
