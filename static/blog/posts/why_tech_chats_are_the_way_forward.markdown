<p>At Tech Residents, we believe that the best way to evaluate a software developer is through rich, technical conversations. &nbsp;This is why we&rsquo;ve made it the central feature of our hiring platform.</p>
<p><strong>Problems with Traditional Interview Methods</strong></p>
<p>Hiring companies have traditionally used tasks like programming puzzles, whiteboard problems, and brain teasers to surface talented developers. &nbsp;While it&rsquo;s possible such tasks could theoretically provide insight into your thinking process and how you solve problems, they are hardly an indicator of your prowess as a developer. &nbsp;The problem is that tasks like this are disconnected from what developers actually do on the job and the skills that are required to do that job. &nbsp;For example, how many times have I ever stood in front of a whiteboard on the job and written code? The answer is exactly zero. &nbsp;Worse yet, most developers despise performing these tasks. &nbsp;It makes them feel like a dog jumping through a flaming hoop.</p>

<p><strong>Using Technical Conversations for Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>At Tech Residents we believe that technical conversations are a great way to evaluate developers. &nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the case whereby you're assigned to work with someone for the first time to help solve a technical problem (e.g. a bug). How long does it take you to figure out if they know what they're doing? Probably only between 5 and 10 minutes.</p>
<p>So why is that? &nbsp;Technical conversations (whether they be about design, bugs, or theory) require many skills from developers in order for the conversation to serve its purpose. &nbsp;As a developer, technical conversations require you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Possess technical breadth and depth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain complex ideas clearly and simply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gauge the technical aptitude of your audience and explain things accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Using technical conversations to evaluate developers also has the advantage of revealing character, energy, and how someone communicates with others. &nbsp;Since most software is built in teams, these insights are particularly important. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The best part about using technical conversations to evaluate developers is that they reflect how developers&nbsp;actually&nbsp;work on the job. &nbsp;No more flaming hoops.</p>
