<p><span>When tasked with describing Tech Residents in 10 words or less we stumbled upon the phrase, 'The Charlie Rose show, but for software developers'. &nbsp;Here's why we think the description works.</span></p>
<p><span>[[MORE]]</span></p>
<p>In case you're not familiar with the Charlie Rose show, it's a talk show hosted by none-other-than Charlie Rose. The format of the show is simple: a round table discussion between Charlie and his guests. &nbsp;Guests of the show range from famous actors and politicians, to businessmen and scientists.</p>
<p><span>Here at Tech Residents we fulfill the role of Charlie Rose. &nbsp;We are the host of the show and you, the developer, are the starring guest. &nbsp;We provide the platform and the quality questions, and you provide the insightful and sometimes surprising answers. &nbsp;Our network of hiring software companies represents the eager audience.</span></p>
<p><span>This metaphor isn't completely accurate however as there are a few key differences between our platform and the real show. &nbsp;For starters, we strive to eliminate bias as much as possible in the hiring process and so we only record the audio from developer chats, not video.</span></p>
<p><span>Another key difference from the real show is that we allow developers to choose exactly which questions and topics to discuss. &nbsp;There are no surprises or curve-ball questions here. &nbsp;Developers choose their chat topics and have the opportunity to record their responses as many times as needed until they're confident they nailed their answer. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>One benefit of Tech Residents playing the role of Charlie Rose is that developers no longer have to worry about a sub-par interviewer playing the part. &nbsp;It can be a real challenge to showcase yourself when the interviewer is leading you into a conversational black hole. &nbsp;By yielding control to developers and allowing them to choose the topics they want to discuss,&nbsp;<span>we allow them to showcase the very best versions of themselves.</span></p>
<p>We realize that comparing ourselves to Charlie Rose, someone whom we admire, is probably a bit unfair to him, but we found the description surprisingly fitting.
