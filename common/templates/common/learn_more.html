            <p>
                Tech Residents is a free platform for software developers to discuss curated technical topics with fellow developers.
                <br/><br/>
                The goal of the platform is to streamline and improve the process of hiring software professionals for both developers and companies.
                <br/><br/>
                The platform works by recording the technical discussions, making them anonymous for your privacy and protection, and finally making them available to our network of hiring companies.
